# 🛒 Fake Product Review Detection System

Detect whether a product review is **Fake or Genuine** using **Machine Learning & NLP**.

---

## 🔍 Why this project?
Fake reviews are a major problem on e-commerce platforms.  
They:
- Mislead customers
- Reduce trust
- Affect purchasing decisions

Manual moderation is slow and not scalable.  
This project provides an **automated AI-based solution** to detect fake product reviews in real time.
